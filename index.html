        <h2>Shrubhi Yadav</h2>
        <ul>
         <li>I'm studying Electronics and Communication
                 at Gyan Ganga Institute of Technology and Sciences
                 in Jabalpur.I love learning about technology
                 and how things work. You know, like how a
                 computer can do so many cool things!</li>
              

          <li>I've learned to write in special 
                computer languages like C, HTML, and CSS. 
                I even used these languages to make
                projects with a cool thing called Arduino Uno,
                which is like a tiny computer.</li>
              

          <li>But it's not just about computers for me. 
                I also really enjoy working with others. 
                I've been in groups where we all help each 
                other and learn together. And guess what? 
                I've even been the leader of a group sometimes!
                That means I help everyone stay organized 
                and make sure things go smoothly.</li>
              

          <li>Now, here's something interesting about me.
                 Sometimes, I get so interested in what 
                 I'm doing that I forget about time! 
                 This means I might spend more time
                 on something than I planned.
                 But I'm getting better at this. 
                 I'm learning to make schedules and 
                 decide what's most important. 
                 And guess what else? I use Google 
                 Calendar to help me remember 
                 what I need to do and when.</li>
              

          <li>So, that's a little bit about me. 
                I like technology, teamwork, and 
                I'm getting better at managing my time.
                 And when I'm not doing all of that, 
                 I enjoy playing games and going 
                 for drives to relax.</li>
